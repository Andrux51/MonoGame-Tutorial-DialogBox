# MonoGame-Tutorial-DialogBox
A code sample to demonstrate how to display and operate a simple rpg-style dialog box with word wrap (aka message box)

##### How does it work?

The player can navigate through pages of the dialog box by pressing Enter or Gamepad button A (_obviously these input choices are arbitrary_). When the final page is reached, pressing the key to continue once more will close the dialog box.

##### Cool, but what does it do for me, the developer?

- Save yourself the trouble of building a dialog box system yourself!
- Turn a long wall of text into something the player will actually read!

##### Awesome, is there anything it doesn't do?
There are a few things that I can think of currently that could improve this, but I don't currently have the need for them in my game, nor do I really have the time to build them out myself.

If you want to contribute by adding these or other features, that'd be awesome!

- [ ] Implement variable speed message display (like how in some games, letters appear in sequence instead of the entire string appearing at once)
- [ ] Background and border customizable with images instead of just colors
- [ ] Dialog box contents able to contain images in addition to text
